Editing the Menu
******************    

Editing the Menu is simple.

1. Load up FTP Software
2. Find the theme.html in the BDWTheme folder
3. You can add a link like the one below after the last one

 | <a href="<{$xoops_url}>/modules/news/">News</a>

Replace the part after <{$xoops_url}> with the path to the link and replace "News" with
whatever you want.

If you wish to delete a Link the simply delete the appropriate line that looks like
the one above but obviously the one that has the link you dont want.
